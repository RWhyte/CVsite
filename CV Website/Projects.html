			<!-- project summary overview -->
			<h3>Project summary</h3>
			<p>-	Project objectives stated <br />
			-	Screen design, flowchart and storyboard creation <br />
			-	Web language discussed and chosen <br />
			-	Website developed <br />
			-	Final designs shown <br />
			-	Possible improvements discussed</p>

			<!-- introduction overview -->
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>This project contains interface designs that consist of screen designs, flowcharts and storyboards to guide the developers <br />
			through the build, development code that thoroughly ensures each aspect of the design is to a professional <br />
			standard, as well as final designs that show how the features within the build are clearly expressed.</p>

			<!-- planning stage overview -->
			<h3>Planning</h3>
			<p><strong>Project Objectives:</strong><br />
			|>	Show the last 5 comments <br />
			|>	Group comments by subject <br />
			|>	Show all the comments in a subject <br />
			|>	Allow new comments to be added <br />
			|>	Identify users through a dynamic login system <br />
			|>	Allocate comments to users based upon their login <br />
			|>	Capture any errors to an error log and provide an export mechanism to allow the data to be analysed in Excel <br />
			|>	Capture web statistics and provide an export mechanism to allow the data to be analysed in Excel <br /><br />
			To meet these project objectives, screen designs were the first step to plan the discussion board <br />
			<strong>Example: </strong><br />
			<img class="screenshot" src="images/screen design.jpg" alt="Screen design example"> <br /><br />
			Once the screen designs were complete, the flowchart was next in line for creation. <br />
			<strong>Example: </strong><br />
			<img class="screenshot" src="images/flowchart.jpg" alt="Flowchart example"> <br /><br />
			Now that the flowchart has been created, storyboards for both computer and mobile devices will be drawn up. <br />
			<strong>Example: </strong><br />
			<img class="screenshot" src="images/computer storyboard.jpg" alt="Computer storyboard example"> <img class="screenshot" src="images/mobile storyboard.jpg" alt="Mobile storyboard example"> <br /><br /></p>

			<!-- development stage overview -->
			<h3>Development</h3>
			<p>To develop the planned out discussion board, the web server scripting language of PHP was chosen due to the database server <br />
			compatibility and critical functions that are unique to PHP. However, the downfall of huge amounts of time spent sending requests <br />
			and receiving pages to display is an big impediment to near all users. Nevertheless, the discussion board development was started <br />
			using just HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. <br />
			<strong>Code Snippets: </strong><br />
			<img class="screenshot" src="images/code snippet 1.jpg" alt="Code snippet example 1"> <img class="screenshot" src="images/code snippet 2.jpg" alt="Code snippet example 2"><br />
			<img class="screenshot" src="images/code snippet 3.jpg" alt="Code snippet example 3"> <img class="screenshot" src="images/code snippet 4.jpg" alt="Code snippet example 4"><br />
			<img class="screenshot" src="images/code snippet 5.jpg" alt="Code snippet example 5"> <img class="screenshot" src="images/code snippet 6.jpg" alt="Code snippet example 6"></p>

			<!-- final submission overview -->
			<h3>Final Submission</h3>
			<p>On completion of the discussion board project, the result ended up almost as planned with a few minor changes here and there. <br />
			Although the website was to a professional standard, it could have been improved a great deal by implementing AJAX with PHP to <br />
			create much faster information requests that would replace the need for mass amounts of pages with only the need for page information. <br />
			Furthermore, the colour scheme and overall style could have been revised to suit a more grown up professional audience rather than <br />
			suiting a more casual younger audience since the market for discussion boards veer more towards adults than younger people. <br />
